As a Data Science Librarian/Consultant in the Center for Data &
Visualization Sciences, I help Duke University students and researchers
navigate practical data science challenges. To that end I provide a
series of workshops on R; offer walk-in and by-appointment
consultations; and host the R we having fun yet learning series (Rfun).

My workshops and presentations focus on using R as a data-first coding
language via the Tidyverse dialect, Reproducibility and tidy data, Text
mining and sentiment analysis, Twitter and APIs, web scraping, data
parsing, data cleaning, and data visualization. Each workshop is
designed as a hands-on experience where you can download practice data,
presentation slides, and workbook guides. Recorded video streaming is
often available.
